# Stanford CS143 Compilers

Stanford compilation principles course, the designer developed a Class-Object-Oriented-Language, COOL language for short.The core of this course is to implement a compiler for COOL language by learning theoretical knowledge, compile COOL high-level language into MIPS assembly and execute it successfully on Spim MIPS simulator.

The theoretical part basically covers lexical analysis, grammatical analysis, semantic analysis, runtime environment, register allocation, code optimization and generation in accordance with the sequence of Dragon book. The practical part is correspondingly divided into lexical analysis, grammatical analysis, semantic analysis, code generation and four stages, which are gradually difficult and leave a lot of design space for students in the optimization part.
